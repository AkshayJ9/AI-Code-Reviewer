{"response":"❌ Bad Code:\n`javascript\nfunction sum(){return a + b;}\n`\n\n🔍 Issues:\n* ❌ `a` and `b` are not
defined within the function, leading to potential errors (either being interpreted as global variables or resulting in a
`ReferenceError` if `'use strict'` is in effect and they're not declared).\n* ❌ The function does not accept any
arguments, limiting its reusability and making it inflexible.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n`javascript\nfunction sum(a, b)
{\n return a + b;\n}\n`\n\n💡 Improvements:\n\n* ✔️ **Defined Arguments:** The function now accepts `a` and `b` as
arguments, making it clear what inputs it expects.\n* ✔️ **Clear Scope:** The variables `a` and `b` are now within the
function's scope, preventing unintended side effects and making the code more predictable.\n* ✔️ **Reusability:** The
function can now be used to sum any two numbers passed as arguments.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n\n* **Input
Validation:** For production code, consider adding input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers before
performing the addition. This can prevent unexpected results (e.g., string concatenation).\n\nExample with Input
Validation:\n\n`javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {\n
console.error(\"Error: Both arguments must be numbers.\");\n return NaN; // Or throw an error, depending on the desired
behavior\n }\n return a + b;\n}\n`\n\nThis revised version is more robust and adheres to better coding practices.\n"}
